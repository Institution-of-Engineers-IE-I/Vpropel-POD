/*

Actual Time
A clock which shows time in 24 hour format, runs ‘x’ minutes faster every one hour. The clock was set to correct time by 0:00. Given the value of ‘x’ and the time shown by the clock when the actual time is ‘h’ hours and ‘0’ minutes, write a C++ code to find hour of the actual time.

For example, if the value of ‘x’ is 10 minutes and the time shown by the clock is 9:20 then the actual time is 8:00 and when ‘x’ is 15 minutes and the time shown by the clock is 12:30 then the actual time is 10:00

Input Format

First line contains the value of ‘x’

Next line contains the hour of the time shown by the clock, ‘h’

Next line contains the minutes of the time shown by the clock, ‘m’

Output Format

Print the hour of actual time
