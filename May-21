Strange Addition Triangle
Karthik and Vijay are friends and they are very much interested in mathematics. Karthik likes books by the Indian mathematician, Shakuntala Devi. He read about Strange Addition Triangle in one of the books by Shakuntala Devi. A strange addition triangle with ten rows looks as below:

1
2 6
3 9 15
4 12 20 28
5 15 25 35 45
6 18 30 42 54 66
7 21 35 49 63 77 91
8 24 40 56 72 88 104 120
9 27 45 63 81 99 117 135 153
10 30 50 70 90 110 130 150 170 190

Karthik told Vijay that the each row in the triangle is formed based on arithmetic progression and there is an interesting phenomenon. Sum of elements each row can be figured out without generating the numbers in the row.

Given the number of rows in a triangle ‘n’ and a row number ‘r’, write a C++ program to find the sum of the elements in the ‘rth’ row and to find the sum of all elements in the triangle.

Boundary Conditions

1<=n<=16000

Input Format

First line contains the number of rows, n

Second line contain the value of the row, r

Output Format

In first line, print the sum of elements in rth row

In the next line, print the sum of elements in the triangle

    return 0;
}


******* METHOD-2 C CODE WITH FORMULA *******

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    long long int n, r, sum, total=0;
    
    scanf("%lld%lld", &n, &r);
    
    sum = r*r*r;
    total = n*n*(n+1)*(n+1)/4;
    
    printf("%lld\n%lld", sum, total);
}

******* METHOD-3 PYTHON CODE FORMULA BASED *******

n = int(input())
r = int(input())

sumr = r**3
total = (n*(n+1)//2)**2

print(sumr, total, sep="\n")
